## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/talent-match-intelligence.git
cd talent-match-intelligence
```

### 2. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
a. Go to Streamlit Cloud.  
b. Click ‚ÄúNew app‚Äù.  
c. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository talent-match-intelligence.  
d. Choose the main branch (usually main) and set the entry point file to:
```bash
app.py
```
e. Click Deploy  
Streamlit Cloud will automatically:  
Install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt.  
Launch your app online.  

### 3. Database Configuration (PostgreSQL / Supabase)
Copy paste the talentmatch_r5_fix script to your SQL Editor.  
This function is the core logic used by the dashboard to calculate Talent Match scores.  
Make sure the function talentmatch_r5_fix is successfully deployed and running in Supabase.  
Configure your Supabase credentials inside app.py:  
```python
url = "https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co"
key = "your-supabase-api-key"
supabase = create_client(url, key)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è You must upload both employee_tv_scores.csv and its duplicate named all_employee in Supabase.  
The employee_tv_scores table is used for benchmark calculation (top performers), while all_employee is used as the comparison dataset for the scoring process.  

### 4. (Optional) Run Locally
If you prefer to test the app on your local machine:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
